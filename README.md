About me(just briefly for now...more details coming soon):
I’m a tech enthusiast and a self taught Frontend Developer👨‍💻 (over 50% 😎) With proficiency in HTML, CSS and JavaScript(..still learning tho).
I love bring new innovations and creating changes that would be impactful in our daily activities. 

Initially, I used to be an ecommerce store developer, helping clients build and develop a profitable online store using CMS platforms such as Wordpress, Wix, Shopify, Godaddy and so on.

I also have some basic knowledge with the use of FIGMA and Adobe for UI/UX Design , looking forward to learn back-end technologies like Node.js and others . 
I'm always motivated and have the desire to learn more.

My Front End stack are :
HTML 5, CSS3, currently learning JavaScript.
